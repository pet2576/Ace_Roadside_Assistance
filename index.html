                <p>Well another year is coming to a close here at ACE Roadside, but that just means more to come, and more to do. We have made some changes as some of you have noticed. Unfortunately some of our operating cost will be going up at the first of the year. To counter this we have increased our Milage rates. Not drastic, but by an extra $.10 a mile. We have already made the transition to help our customers get acclimated  to this pricing difference. Thank you for understanding, and staying with us for another year.</p>
                <h3 class="social-media">Social Media</h3>
                <p>Also we have expanded our social media coverage. You can now check out our work on our Instagram page for other pictures that you cant see anywhere else. Thank you again and we look forward to another great year.</p>
                <h3 class="invoice-changes">Invoice Changes</h3>
                <p>Meet our new invoices. We have gone completely electronic with printed paper copies. If you call us we can email or fax your invoices roadside!!! We strive to advance not only our technical abilities for our customer, but advancing our office work to better suit your needs.</p>
